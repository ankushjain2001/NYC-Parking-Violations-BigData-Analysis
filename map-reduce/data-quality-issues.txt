1. NaN values:
    parking-violations.csv  : Column Indices [3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20]
    open-violations.csv     : Column Indices [1, 3, 7, 8, 10, 11]

2. For Task 1, not all open-violations were present in the parking-violations

3. In open-violations, 4 documents had punctuation marks (comma) in the 'plate' variable. In the manual line by line parsing of CSV using the split method with comma as the delimiter, these documents can produce errors. Hence, using a CSV reader is a reliable method.
